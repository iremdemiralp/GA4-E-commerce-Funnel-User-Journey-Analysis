# GA4 E-commerce Funnel & User Journey Analysis

This project focuses on analyzing user behavior throughout the e-commerce funnel using Google Analytics 4 sample data.  
The goal was to visualize key drop-off points and identify opportunities for conversion optimization.

## 🔍 Overview

- I applied advanced SQL techniques using Common Table Expressions (CTEs) in Google BigQuery to efficiently extract and structure complex, nested Google Analytics   4 event data for thorough analysis.  
- I focused on critical e-commerce funnel stages — `view_item`, `add_to_cart`, `checkout`, and `purchase` — to monitor user progression closely and identify         precise drop-off points within the conversion path.  
- I developed a dynamic, interactive dashboard with multi-dimensional filters by date, campaign, device language, and device category, empowering myself and         stakeholders to explore data deeply and make data-driven optimization decisions.


## 📌 Key Findings & Recommendations

- **Mobile User Experience Needs Improvement:**  
  Despite higher mobile sessions, the conversion rate is relatively low. Prioritize responsive design and speed optimization to enhance mobile performance.
- **Organic Traffic Optimization:**  
  Focus on SEO and content strategies to boost organic traffic conversion.
- **Market Diversification:**  
  Develop targeted campaigns for high-potential markets outside the US, such as India and Canada.
- **Simplify Add-to-Cart and Checkout Processes:**  
  Reduce the number of steps and unnecessary forms in the checkout flow to minimize drop-offs.
- **Campaign Management:**  
  Prioritize high-performing campaigns from Google and referral sources; optimize or pause low-converting campaigns.
